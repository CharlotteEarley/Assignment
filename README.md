# Assignment

The aim of this study is to determine which regions of Chittagong, Bangladesh, currently have least access to medical and educational services. This repository contains instructions to load three detailed maps, and information on how to interpret the readout produced.

Map 1: Overview of Bangladesh
This map shows rivers and states within the country of Bangladesh. It also features a raster layer backdrop for context.

Map 2: A focus on the study area of Chittagong, with analysis of the region and descriptive statistics
Map 2 looks at the Chittagong state in more detail. At the end of this script a short bit of analysis printout is included.

Map 3: Chloropleth map of population in Chittagong
This map shows population distribution across the state of Chittagong at ward level. We can see which states have the highest population and that to the eastern border population density drops considerably.

All analysis is written in python. Data was sourced from the Centre for Humanitarian Data, at data.humdata.org, and is also provided in a folder in this repository for easy access.
